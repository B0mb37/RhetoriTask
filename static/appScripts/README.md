### Data Integrity
It is important to maintain data integrity
**Avoid:** 
    - mistaenly changing any data in the spreadsheet
    - accidental edits to formulas in the spreadsheet

### Data Privacy and Security
Some information shared online can be sensitive, hence need to be careful with sharing the spreadhseet you are working on. Counter check that the spreadsheet is not public if you do not wish it to be, and make sure 

### Updates and Maintenance
I may periodically update or improve the spreadsheet and it's functionalities.
As noted on the root README of this project, the spreadsheet is only a temporary easy to wor with solution to a full app that can tab public speaking tournaments.
I therefore encourage every tabbing official to be checking with this repository and find out about either improvements to the spreadsheet o0or the release of the tabbing application itself.
